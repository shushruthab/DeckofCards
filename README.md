## Project Details

Deck of Cards is an app that displays a deck of cards, one card at a time. When you click a button the page will draw one card every second. These draws will continue until you press the button again, or until the deck has been exhausted. If you try to draw when there are no cards remaining, an alert message should appear on the screen with the text “Error: no cards remaining!”.

The app was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
